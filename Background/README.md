## Wiki Articles Worth Reading
In my opinion, Wikipedia is the best starting point when you are trying to acquire a new skill.
- [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
- [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)
- [Machine Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_vision)


## Interesting Links
Read through these two articles to get a general idea of what we're supposed to be doing:
- [Deep learning object detection on dental x rays](https://medium.com/@clemkoa/deep-learning-object-detection-on-dental-x-rays-8211e48e520b)
- [Improving deep learning object detection on dental x-rays](https://medium.com/@clemkoa/deep-learning-on-dental-x-rays-part-2-fbee8382ffc3)


## Step by Step Guide
The only way to learn how to program is to get your hands dirty :).
